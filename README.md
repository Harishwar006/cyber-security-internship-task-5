Task 5: Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark

📌 Overview

This project demonstrates basic network traffic capture and analysis using Wireshark. The goal of this task is to understand how data packets travel across a network and to identify commonly used network protocols.

This task was completed as part of a Cyber Security Internship to build hands-on skills in packet analysis and protocol awareness.


---

🎯 Objective

Capture live network packets

Analyze different network protocols

Understand basic TCP/IP communication

Gain practical experience with Wireshark



---

🛠 Tools Used

Wireshark (Free & Open Source)

Kali Linux

Active network interface (Wi-Fi / Ethernet)



---

🧪 Task Workflow

1. Installed Wireshark on Kali Linux


2. Started packet capture on the active network interface

3. Generated network traffic by:
Browsing websites
Pinging servers

4. Captured packets for approximately one minute

5. Applied protocol filters (HTTP, DNS, TCP, etc.)

6. Identified multiple network protocols

7. Exported the captured traffic as a .pcap file

8. Analyzed packet details and summarized findings

---

🔍 Protocols Identified

TCP – Reliable, connection-oriented communication

UDP – Fast, connectionless communication

DNS – Domain name resolution

HTTP / HTTPS – Web traffic

ICMP – Ping and network diagnostics
