 📡 Network Traffic Capture and Analysis using Wireshark (Kali Linux)

📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to capture and analyze live network traffic using **Wireshark** on **Kali Linux**.  
The objective is to understand how network packets flow, identify common protocols, and gain hands-on experience in packet analysis, which is a core skill in cybersecurity and network troubleshooting.

---

🎯 Objective
- Capture live network packets from an active network interface
- Analyze different types of network traffic
- Identify and filter multiple network protocols
- Export packet capture for documentation and analysis

---

 🛠 Tools & Environment
*Operating System:** Kali Linux  
*Tool Used:** Wireshark  
*File Format:** `.pcap`  

---

🧪 Task Description
The following steps were performed as part of this task:

1. Installed Wireshark on Kali Linux
2. Selected the active network interface (Wi-Fi / Ethernet)
3. Started live packet capture
4. Generated network traffic by:
   - Browsing websites
   - Pinging external servers
5. Stopped capture after sufficient traffic was collected
6. Applied protocol filters in Wireshark
7. Identified multiple network protocols
8. Exported captured packets as a `.pcap` file
9. Documented observations and findings

🔍 Protocols Identified
During packet analysis, the following protocols were observed:

*TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**  
  Reliable, connection-oriented communication

*UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**  
  Fast, connectionless data transfer

*DNS (Domain Name System)**  
  Resolves domain names to IP addresses

*HTTP / HTTPS**  
  Web communication protocols
